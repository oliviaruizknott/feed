Hi! We’re* making a game. It’s called “Feed!”. It’s about social media. You can play what we have so far here: http://oliviaruizknott.github.io/feed/

*“We” is Olivia Ruiz-Knott, Ivan Ruiz-Knott, and Norton King.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template. It’s deployed using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

To get up and running locally, clone the repo, then run `npm install` in the project directory.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run deploy`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Automatically deployed to GitHub pages!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
